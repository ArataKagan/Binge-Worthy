## Technical Choices 

### React/Redux: 

- Reason of the choice: 

I've chosen React because I have prior experience building React applications and it's suited for building progressive web applications with its performance and fast rendering. 

### Node/Express: 

Since I have experience building Node applications and it has great compatibility with React library, I've chosen Node/Express for the back-end.
